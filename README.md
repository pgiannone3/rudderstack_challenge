# rudderstack_challenge

In March 2023 Rudderstack organized a challenge to add transformations to its system. 
A transformation is simply a function that takes a message as input and transforms it in some way. 

I created a very simple transformation that takes a message as input and, based on the country of origin, automatically adds the country code to a phone field that is provided. 
I also added some tests done with Jest to familiarize myself with this testing framework.
